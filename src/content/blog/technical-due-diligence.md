# A Framework for Technical Due Diligence

After evaluating numerous startups, I've developed a framework for technical due diligence that focuses on key areas that matter for early-stage companies.

## Architecture & Scalability

Key areas to evaluate:
- System architecture decisions
- Technical debt assessment
- Scalability bottlenecks
- Infrastructure choices

## Team & Process

Understanding the human side:
- Engineering team composition
- Development processes
- Code review practices
- Technical documentation

## Security & Compliance

Critical considerations:
- Security practices
- Data protection
- Compliance readiness
- Risk management

The goal isn't perfection, but understanding risk and potential.
