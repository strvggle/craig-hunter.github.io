# Building a Strong Remote-First Engineering Culture

Remote work isn't just about tools and processes - it's about intentionally building culture. Here's what I've learned about creating strong remote engineering teams.

## Async by Default

Building async-first practices:
- Written communication emphasis
- Clear documentation requirements
- Flexible work hours
- Global-friendly processes

## Tools & Infrastructure

Essential remote infrastructure:
- Robust code review tools
- Documentation systems
- Communication platforms
- Project management tools

## Building Connection

Maintaining team cohesion:
- Virtual social events
- Regular 1:1s
- Team building activities
- In-person offsites

Success in remote work comes from intentional culture building.
