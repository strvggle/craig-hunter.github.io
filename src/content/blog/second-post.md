# Building in Public: My Approach to Personal Projects

I believe in the power of building in public. It creates accountability, encourages collaboration, and helps others learn from both successes and failures.

## Why Build in Public?

1. Community Feedback
2. Accountability
3. Knowledge Sharing
4. Network Building

## Current Projects

Here are some projects I'm currently working on:
- This personal site (built with simple, modern web technologies)
- Various open-source contributions
- Technical documentation and guides
