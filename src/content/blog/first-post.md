# Building Remote Engineering Teams

One of the biggest challenges and opportunities in modern tech is building and scaling remote engineering teams. Having led teams at Dropbox and Flexport, here are my key learnings about making remote work successful.

## Clear Communication is Everything

The most successful remote teams I've worked with have excellent async communication habits. This means:

- Detailed PRs with context and reasoning
- Well-documented decisions in accessible places
- Regular written updates on project status
- Clear documentation of processes and expectations

## Building Culture Remotely

Culture isn't just about office perks - it's about how teams work together. Some effective practices:

- Regular 1:1s focused on career growth
- Virtual pair programming sessions
- Team show-and-tells
- Celebrating wins publicly

## Tools and Infrastructure

The right tools make remote work much smoother:

- Robust code review processes
- Clear on-call rotations
- Well-documented runbooks
- Effective async communication channels

Remote work is here to stay. The teams that thrive will be those that embrace its challenges and build processes that support async, distributed work.
