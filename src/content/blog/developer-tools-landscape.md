# The Evolution of Developer Tools

The developer tools landscape has evolved significantly in recent years. From my experience both building and investing in dev tools, here are the trends I'm watching.

## AI Integration

The impact of AI on development:
- Code completion and generation
- Automated testing
- Documentation assistance
- Developer productivity

## Developer Experience

Focus on DX improvements:
- Simplified workflows
- Better debugging tools
- Integrated development environments
- Low-friction deployment

## Cloud Native Development

The shift to cloud-native:
- Container orchestration
- Serverless platforms
- Infrastructure as code
- Microservices tooling

The future of development is more automated and integrated.
